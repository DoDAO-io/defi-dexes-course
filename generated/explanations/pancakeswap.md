 ## PancakeSwap
 
 **Pancakeswap**        
Pancakeswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform designed to support **high-speed transactions** and **low fees**. Pancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

### How Does Pancakeswap Work?

Pancakeswap is built on the Binance Smart Chain, which utilizes the same technology as the Binance Chain but includes additional features such as smart contracts. This allows Pancakeswap to offer a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, and trading.

Users can access Pancakeswap through a web browser or through a compatible wallet such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Once connected, users can browse the available assets and trade them on the exchange. Pancakeswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, which means that users don't have to wait for their orders to be matched with other buyers or sellers. Instead, the AMM algorithm calculates the price of each asset based on the supply and demand of the market.

### Binance Smart Chain


Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network developed by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that it can run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) that are built on Ethereum.


BSC was designed to offer the benefits of Ethereum's smart contract functionality, while also providing faster transaction speeds and lower fees. It uses a **proof-of-staked-authority** (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which means that block validation is performed by a group of validators who have staked a certain amount of the Binance Coin (BNB) cryptocurrency.


BSC has its own native cryptocurrency, called **Binance Coin** (BNB), which is used to pay transaction fees on the network. It also supports a wide range of other cryptocurrency assets, including those built on Ethereum and other networks.


### Also Available on Aptos


PancakeSwap announced its decision to deploy its native multichain proposal, which saw the CAKE token distributed on the Aptos blockchain. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the move, with around 99% of the votes in favor. 


The PancakeSwap team cited the low transaction costs and speed of transactions on the Aptos blockchain as the main reasons for this decision. 


The deployment of PancakeSwap on Aptos included four main features: exchanges, farms, pools, and initial farm offerings. The CAKE token was also natively available on the Aptos blockchain. The deployment took place in two phases, with phase 1 focusing on liquidity extraction programs and phase 2 launching ramps for new projects. PancakeSwap worked closely with the Aptos team to ensure a smooth deployment, with all four key products expected to be available by the end of November. 


There was no change to the CAKE tokenomics, but the distribution of CAKE emissions between the two chains was managed by the PancakeSwap team in a way that promoted the burning of more CAKE. 


There have been criticisms of Aptos in the past, including a lack of initial transparency, misleading advertising, and a large allocation of VC tokens to developers and private investors. However, PancakeSwap believes that the project has the potential to be improved continuously.


### The Exchange


Pancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as lesser-known altcoins and NFTs. Users can view the available assets and their prices on the Pancakeswap exchange, and can place orders to buy or sell using the AMM algorithm.


One of the key features of Pancakeswap is its liquidity pools, which allow users to provide liquidity to the exchange in exchange for a share of the fees generated by the trades. This helps to ensure that there is always a healthy supply of assets available for trading and allows users to earn a passive income by providing liquidity.


### Syrup Pools 

One of the unique features of Pancakeswap is its syrup pools. These are liquidity pools that allow users to provide liquidity to the platform in exchange for a share of the trading fees. Staking in Syrup Pools lets you earn CAKE or other tokens while you sleep!


It's simpler than farming with PancakeSwap's Yield Farms because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake one token to start earning: usually CAKE.


PancakeSwap now offers one CAKE Syrup Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking.


**Flexible staking** allows users to stake their CAKE and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. There is a small **unstaking fee of 0.1%** within the first **72 hours** of staking and a **performance fee of 2%** that is subtracted automatically from each yield harvest. The CAKE collected via these fees is burned every week as part of the regular CAKE token burns.


**Fixed-term staking** allows users to maximize their yield by locking their staked CAKE for a period of time in exchange for a linearly boosted yield compared to flexible staking. There are **no performance fees** for fixed-term staking, and the longer the lock period, the higher the boost applied to the yield. CAKE rewards will be locked along with the staked CAKE until the staking duration ends, and once staked in fixed-term staking, users cannot withdraw until the end of their lock duration. In addition to higher yields, fixed-term staking also offers additional benefits such as boosted voting power, boosted farm yields, and priority access to IFO public sales and special events.


Both flexible staking and fixed-term staking are part of the same pool, allowing users to easily migrate between the two options. However, once CAKE is staked in fixed-term staking, users can perform flexible staking on the side. The CAKE Syrup Pool is a great way for users to earn more CAKE and take advantage of the additional benefits offered through fixed-term staking.


### Rewards


Yield farming on PancakeSwap is a way for users to earn the platform's native token, CAKE, by providing liquidity to the DEX's liquidity pools and staking liquidity provider (LP) tokens in yield farms. When a user provides liquidity to a liquidity pool, they receive LP tokens that represent their share of the pool. These LP tokens can then be staked in a yield farm to earn CAKE rewards.


The **annual percentage rate** (APR) earned through yield farming on PancakeSwap is made up of two components: the LP rewards APR earned through providing liquidity, and the farm base rewards APR earned by staking LP tokens in the farm. By staking LP tokens in a farm, users can earn CAKE rewards while still maintaining a position in their other tokens.


To calculate the farm base reward APR, the farm multiplier and the total amount of liquidity in the farm are used. The farm base APR is the amount of CAKE (the native token of PancakeSwap) distributed to the farm.


To calculate the LP reward APR, the yearly fees earned by the pool are divided by the liquidity. For example, let's say there is $387.42M in liquidity and the 24-hour volume is $96.97M. The fee share of liquidity providers in the pool can be calculated by multiplying the 24-hour volume by the trading fee structure (0.17% in this case): $96,970,000 * 0.17 / 100 = $164,849. The projected yearly fees earned by the pool can then be calculated by multiplying this fee share by the number of days in a year: $164,849 * 365 = $60,169,885. Finally, the LP rewards APR can be calculated by dividing the yearly fees by the liquidity: ($60,169,885 / $387,420,000) * 100 = 15.53% LP reward APR.


Unlike Syrup Pools, Farms require you to stake two tokens to get LP Tokens, which you then stake in the Farm to earn rewards. This lets you earn CAKE while still keeping a position in your other tokens!


It is important to note that yield farming on PancakeSwap with a risk of impermanent loss. This occurs when the value of the tokens in the liquidity pool changes over time, leading to a difference between the value of the tokens when they were added to the pool and their value when they are withdrawn. This can result in a loss for the liquidity provider, even if the value of the tokens they received as a reward has increased.


### StableSwap


StableSwap is a feature on PancakeSwap, that allows users to trade stablecoin pairs with **lower slippage**. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. StableSwap uses an invariant curve slippage function to achieve this, which helps to keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is not extremely unbalanced.


StableSwap is implemented using an automated market maker (AMM) model developed by Curve Finance, which utilizes liquidity pools to match buy and sell orders for a particular asset. The AMM model used by StableSwap includes a **linear invariant constant sum curve** in addition to the constant product formula used in normal AMMs. This helps to reduce impermanent loss, which occurs when the price of an asset changes while it is being held in a liquidity pool, and lowers the slippage compared to normal AMMs that use only the constant product formula.


StableSwap is designed to swap specific assets that are priced closely, such as USD stablecoins like HAY, BUSD, and USDT, or liquid staking tokens like stkBNB and aBNBc. When using StableSwap, users will pay **lower trading fees** compared to the standard 0.25% fee on normal PancakeSwap AMMs.

### Lottery V2


Another popular feature of Pancakeswap is the lottery V2. It allows users to purchase lottery tickets using BSC tokens. The winners are chosen randomly, and the prizes can be anything from tokens to NFTs. The lottery V2 has become very popular on Pancakeswap, as it allows users to try their luck at winning a portion of the lottery's prize pool. The size of the prize pool depends on the number of tickets sold and the amount of BNB or CAKE that is wagered.


### Prediction


Pancakeswap also has a prediction feature that allows users to make predictions on the future value of different tokens. The users who make the most accurate predictions are rewarded with tokens. This feature has become very popular on Pancakeswap as it allows users to test their knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and potentially earn some rewards.


### Pottery


Pottery is a yield farming strategy on PancakeSwap that allows users to earn CAKE, the platform's native token, by depositing CAKE and participating in a lottery-style drawing. To participate in Pottery, users must deposit a **minimum of 1 CAKE** on the Pottery page during a specified period, which occurs on the **Friday before the first Monday of each month**. The deposited CAKE is directed to a lock-staking pool and locked for **ten weeks**. During this time, **80%** of the total staking rewards generated from the deposited CAKE are directed to a prize pool for weekly drawings, and the remaining **20%** are reserved for withdrawal after the ten weeks are complete. With Pottery, you will be guaranteed to get back 100% of what you deposited in 10 weeks. However, you can only withdraw your CAKE deposit after 10 weeks of locking, without any other way to withdraw early. The chance of winning a prize in the weekly drawings is determined by the size of the user's deposit relative to the overall pool. Pottery uses **Chainlink's implementation of VRF** (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure the security and randomness of the drawing process.


### The NFT Marketplace


Pancakeswap has its own NFT marketplace where users can buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The NFTs on the platform are divided into different categories, such as art, collectibles, and gaming. In order to be considered for listing on PancakeSwap, an NFT collection must meet certain technical and business requirements. Technical requirements include following **BEP-721 standards**, being **100% minted**, and hosting metadata on a decentralized platform like **IPFS**. Business requirements include having an **active community**, a working **website** with detailed information about the collection, and **active social channels**. PancakeSwap will assess projects on a case-by-case basis, and may ask for additional due diligence information.


### The NFT Profile System


Pancakeswap also has an NFT profile system that allows users to showcase their NFT collection. The NFT profile system allows users to display their NFTs in a virtual gallery, and other users can view and interact with the NFTs. The NFT profile system has become very popular on Pancakeswap, with users using it to show off their NFT collections and discover new NFTs.


### Initial Farm Offerings

Pancakeswap also has initial farm offerings (IFOs) that allow users to earn tokens by providing liquidity to a new project. IFO is a way for the platform to raise funds and create initial liquidity for the CAKE token. The IFOs on Pancakeswap are usually open for a limited time, and users who provide liquidity during the IFO period are rewarded with tokens. Pancakeswap uses a "dutch auction" format for its IFOs. This means that the price of CAKE decreases over time until the IFO ends, and users can purchase CAKE at the lowest price reached during the IFO. This allows users to purchase CAKE at a discount compared to the price it will be traded at once the IFO ends.
 
 **CAKE Token**        
CAKE is a cryptocurrency token that is used on the Pancakeswap decentralized exchange (DEX). It is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token and is used for a variety of purposes on the Pancakeswap platform, including staking, governance, and liquidity provision.


The total supply of CAKE is capped at 750 million tokens, and the tokens are distributed through various means, such as liquidity provision, staking, farming, and airdrops. The demand for CAKE is driven by its various use cases on the Pancakeswap platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.


Some uses cases of CAKE are:
* One of the main use cases of CAKE is staking, which allows users to earn a share of the trading fees on the Pancakeswap platform. Users can stake their CAKE tokens in liquidity pools or farm pools to earn a share of the fees. The amount of CAKE that users earn depends on the amount of CAKE they stake and the overall demand for the pool.
* Another use case of CAKE is governance, which allows users to vote on important decisions related to the Pancakeswap platform. Users who hold CAKE tokens can participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the platform. The votes of CAKE holders are weighted based on the amount of CAKE they hold, and the outcomes of the votes are used to make decisions about the platform.
* Finally, CAKE is used for liquidity provision on Pancakeswap. Users can provide liquidity to the platform by adding their CAKE and other tokens to liquidity pools. In return, they receive a share of the trading fees and can earn rewards in the form of CAKE. The demand for CAKE is driven by the need for liquidity on the platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.


### iCAKE


iCake is a numerical metric used by the PancakeSwap Initial Farm Offering (IFO) system to determine the maximum commit limit in IFO public sales. It is not a new token, but rather a way to reward loyal CAKE holders with increased IFO benefits. iCake is based on the number of CAKE staked in the fixed-term CAKE staking pool and the total staking duration of the user's current fixed-term staking position.


The number of iCake a user has is determined by a staking duration threshold. If the user's staking duration is above the threshold, the number of iCake they have is equal to the number of CAKE in their staking position. If the staking duration is below the threshold, the number of iCake is linearly decreased and adjusted. If the staking position is ended, the number of iCake is set to zero. The threshold is adjusted by PancakeSwap based on the average staking duration of the fixed-term staking CAKE pool between each IFO.


In addition to the introduction of iCake, PancakeSwap is also bringing improvements to the IFO experience and updates to the fixed-term CAKE staking pool. The upcoming IFO will include the use of iCake to calculate the maximum CAKE commit limit and a token vesting feature, which releases tokens from IFO sales over a period of time rather than all at once. This helps promote stability and community engagement by preventing a large supply shock.


Overall, iCake is an important feature of the PancakeSwap platform that rewards loyal CAKE holders and helps to promote stability and community engagement in the IFO process.


### vCAKE


vCake is a numerical metric used by the PancakeSwap platform to represent the boosted voting power of a user based on their fixed-term CAKE staking position. It is not a new token, but rather a way to reward fixed-term CAKE holders with increased voting power. vCake is calculated based on the amount of CAKE staked in the fixed-term staking pool and the remaining lock duration of the staking position.


If the remaining staking duration is less than one week, the user's vCake is equal to the amount of CAKE staked in the pool. If the staking duration is more than one week, the vCake is equal to the amount of CAKE staked multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position. For example, if a user has staked 100 CAKE for 52 weeks and their staking position will unlock in 40 weeks, they would have 4000 vCake.


vCake is an important feature of the PancakeSwap platform that rewards fixed-term CAKE holders and helps to promote stability and community engagement in the governance process. It was introduced through a 72-hour vote on the platform. Overall, vCake is expected to bring benefits to both fixed-term CAKE stakers and the overall CAKE ecosystem.


### bCAKE

bCAKE is a feature on PancakeSwap that allows users to boost the yield of their liquidity farming by staking fixed-term CAKE. bCAKE is not a new token, but rather a series of boost multipliers that can be applied to selected liquidity farms on PancakeSwap. The multipliers are calculated based on various metrics, including the number of CAKE staked in the fixed-term position, the duration of the staking position, and the number of LP tokens staked in the farm. Global metrics, such as the total amount of CAKE locked in the staking pool and the average lock duration, are also taken into account in the calculation. 


bCAKE can be easily activated by staking CAKE and then using the farm booster feature on the PancakeSwap farm page. Initially, bCAKE will only be available for the CAKE/BUSD farm and will have a maximum boost of 2x. However, the PancakeSwap team plans to expand the feature to other farms and increase the maximum boost in the future.


### Criteria for listing Tokens

There are a few general criteria that a token must meet in order to be listed on PancakeSwap. These include:

* The token must be built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
* The token must have a functional product or service.
* The token must have a transparent and active team behind it.
* The token must have a clear and reasonable token economics model.
* The token must not engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities.

If a token meets these criteria, it can potentially be listed on PancakeSwap. However, it is important to note that PancakeSwap has the final say on whether or not a token will be listed on the platform.
