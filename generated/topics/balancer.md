## Balancer
 
Balancer's smart pools use a constant mean formula which allows for more than two assets and weights outside of fifty-fifty, making it different from other pooling options. Balancer pools are able to include up to eight tokens at any number of weights. The constant mean formula also permits adaptive fee structures that can react to market forces like volatility or demand, giving projects the ability to experiment with liquidity.
