## Uniswap
 
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum that allows users to exchange ERC-20 tokens. It was one of the first decentralized exchanges to gain widespread adoption and is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Unlike centralized exchanges, which match buyers and sellers and facilitate trades on their own platforms, Uniswap allows users to trade directly with one another without the need for an intermediary. This makes it easier for users to trade without the need to go through know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and without the risk of having their funds held by a centralized entity that could be hacked or go bankrupt.
