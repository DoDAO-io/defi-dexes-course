          "key": "pancake-introduction",
          "details": "Pancakeswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform designed to support **high-speed transactions** and **low fees**. Pancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n### How Does Pancakeswap Work?\n\nPancakeswap is built on the Binance Smart Chain, which utilizes the same technology as the Binance Chain but includes additional features such as smart contracts. This allows Pancakeswap to offer a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, and trading.\n\nUsers can access Pancakeswap through a web browser or through a compatible wallet such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Once connected, users can browse the available assets and trade them on the exchange. Pancakeswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, which means that users don't have to wait for their orders to be matched with other buyers or sellers. Instead, the AMM algorithm calculates the price of each asset based on the supply and demand of the market.\n\n### Binance Smart Chain\n\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network developed by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that it can run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) that are built on Ethereum.\n\n\nBSC was designed to offer the benefits of Ethereum's smart contract functionality, while also providing faster transaction speeds and lower fees. It uses a **proof-of-staked-authority** (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which means that block validation is performed by a group of validators who have staked a certain amount of the Binance Coin (BNB) cryptocurrency.\n\n\nBSC has its own native cryptocurrency, called **Binance Coin** (BNB), which is used to pay transaction fees on the network. It also supports a wide range of other cryptocurrency assets, including those built on Ethereum and other networks.\n\n### The Exchange\n\n\nPancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as lesser-known altcoins and NFTs. Users can view the available assets and their prices on the Pancakeswap exchange, and can place orders to buy or sell using the AMM algorithm.\n\n\nOne of the key features of Pancakeswap is its liquidity pools, which allow users to provide liquidity to the exchange in exchange for a share of the fees generated by the trades. This helps to ensure that there is always a healthy supply of assets available for trading and allows users to earn a passive income by providing liquidity.\n\n\n### Rewards\n\n\nYield farming on PancakeSwap is a way for users to earn the platform's native token, CAKE, by providing liquidity to the DEX's liquidity pools and staking liquidity provider (LP) tokens in yield farms. When a user provides liquidity to a liquidity pool, they receive LP tokens that represent their share of the pool. These LP tokens can then be staked in a yield farm to earn CAKE rewards.\n\n\nThe **annual percentage rate** (APR) earned through yield farming on PancakeSwap is made up of two components: the LP rewards APR earned through providing liquidity, and the farm base rewards APR earned by staking LP tokens in the farm. By staking LP tokens in a farm, users can earn CAKE rewards while still maintaining a position in their other tokens.\n\n\nTo calculate the farm base reward APR, the farm multiplier and the total amount of liquidity in the farm are used. The farm base APR is the amount of CAKE (the native token of PancakeSwap) distributed to the farm.\n\n\nTo calculate the LP reward APR, the yearly fees earned by the pool are divided by the liquidity. For example, let's say there is $387.42M in liquidity and the 24-hour volume is $96.97M. The fee share of liquidity providers in the pool can be calculated by multiplying the 24-hour volume by the trading fee structure (0.17% in this case): $96,970,000 * 0.17 / 100 = $164,849. The projected yearly fees earned by the pool can then be calculated by multiplying this fee share by the number of days in a year: $164,849 * 365 = $60,169,885. Finally, the LP rewards APR can be calculated by dividing the yearly fees by the liquidity: ($60,169,885 / $387,420,000) * 100 = 15.53% LP reward APR.\n\n\nIt is important to note that yield farming on PancakeSwap with a risk of impermanent loss. This occurs when the value of the tokens in the liquidity pool changes over time, leading to a difference between the value of the tokens when they were added to the pool and their value when they are withdrawn. This can result in a loss for the liquidity provider, even if the value of the tokens they received as a reward has increased.\n\n\n### Syrup Pools \n\n\nOne of the unique features of Pancakeswap is its syrup pools. These are liquidity pools that allow users to provide liquidity to the platform in exchange for a share of the trading fees. The syrup pools are divided into different categories, such as stablecoin pools, token pools, and farm pools. Each pool has its own set of rules and rewards, and users can choose the pool that best suits their needs.\n\n\n### StableSwap\n\n\nStableSwap is a feature on PancakeSwap, that allows users to trade stablecoin pairs with **lower slippage**. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. StableSwap uses an invariant curve slippage function to achieve this, which helps to keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is not extremely unbalanced.\n\n\nStableSwap is implemented using an automated market maker (AMM) model developed by Curve Finance, which utilizes liquidity pools to match buy and sell orders for a particular asset. The AMM model used by StableSwap includes a **linear invariant constant sum curve** in addition to the constant product formula used in normal AMMs. This helps to reduce impermanent loss, which occurs when the price of an asset changes while it is being held in a liquidity pool, and lowers the slippage compared to normal AMMs that use only the constant product formula.\n\n\nStableSwap is designed to swap specific assets that are priced closely, such as USD stablecoins like HAY, BUSD, and USDT, or liquid staking tokens like stkBNB and aBNBc. When using StableSwap, users will pay **lower trading fees** compared to the standard 0.25% fee on normal PancakeSwap AMMs.\n\n### Lottery V2\n\n\nAnother popular feature of Pancakeswap is the lottery V2. It allows users to purchase lottery tickets using BSC tokens. The winners are chosen randomly, and the prizes can be anything from tokens to NFTs. The lottery V2 has become very popular on Pancakeswap, as it allows users to try their luck at winning a portion of the lottery's prize pool. The size of the prize pool depends on the number of tickets sold and the amount of BNB or CAKE that is wagered.\n\n\n### Prediction\n\n\nPancakeswap also has a prediction feature that allows users to make predictions on the future value of different tokens. The users who make the most accurate predictions are rewarded with tokens. This feature has become very popular on Pancakeswap as it allows users to test their knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and potentially earn some rewards.\n\n\n### Pottery\n\n\nPottery is a yield farming strategy on PancakeSwap that allows users to earn CAKE, the platform's native token, by depositing CAKE and participating in a lottery-style drawing. To participate in Pottery, users must deposit a **minimum of 1 CAKE** on the Pottery page during a specified period, which occurs on the **Friday before the first Monday of each month**. The deposited CAKE is directed to a lock-staking pool and locked for **ten weeks**. During this time, **80%** of the total staking rewards generated from the deposited CAKE are directed to a prize pool for weekly drawings, and the remaining **20%** are reserved for withdrawal after the ten weeks are complete. The chance of winning a prize in the weekly drawings is determined by the size of the user's deposit relative to the overall pool. Pottery uses **Chainlink's implementation of VRF** (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure the security and randomness of the drawing process.\n\n\n### The NFT Marketplace\n\n\nPancakeswap has its own NFT marketplace where users can buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The NFTs on the platform are divided into different categories, such as art, collectibles, and gaming. In order to be considered for listing on PancakeSwap, an NFT collection must meet certain technical and business requirements. Technical requirements include following **BEP-721 standards**, being **100% minted**, and hosting metadata on a decentralized platform like **IPFS**. Business requirements include having an **active community**, a working **website** with detailed information about the collection, and **active social channels**. PancakeSwap will assess projects on a case-by-case basis, and may ask for additional due diligence information.\n\n\n### The NFT Profile System\n\n\nPancakeswap also has an NFT profile system that allows users to showcase their NFT collection. The NFT profile system allows users to display their NFTs in a virtual gallery, and other users can view and interact with the NFTs. The NFT profile system has become very popular on Pancakeswap, with users using it to show off their NFT collections and discover new NFTs.\n\n\n### Initial Farm Offerings\n\nPancakeswap also has initial farm offerings (IFOs) that allow users to earn tokens by providing liquidity to a new project. IFO is a way for the platform to raise funds and create initial liquidity for the CAKE token. The IFOs on Pancakeswap are usually open for a limited time, and users who provide liquidity during the IFO period are rewarded with tokens. Pancakeswap uses a \"dutch auction\" format for its IFOs. This means that the price of CAKE decreases over time until the IFO ends, and users can purchase CAKE at the lowest price reached during the IFO. This allows users to purchase CAKE at a discount compared to the price it will be traded at once the IFO ends.\n"

          "title": "CAKE Token",
          "shortTitle": "CAKE",
          "key": "cake-token",
          "details": "CAKE is a cryptocurrency token that is used on the Pancakeswap decentralized exchange (DEX). It is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token and is used for a variety of purposes on the Pancakeswap platform, including staking, governance, and liquidity provision.\n\n\nThe total supply of CAKE is capped at 750 million tokens, and the tokens are distributed through various means, such as liquidity provision, staking, farming, and airdrops. The demand for CAKE is driven by its various use cases on the Pancakeswap platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.\n\n\nOne of the main use cases of CAKE is staking, which allows users to earn a share of the trading fees on the Pancakeswap platform. Users can stake their CAKE tokens in liquidity pools or farm pools to earn a share of the fees. The amount of CAKE that users earn depends on the amount of CAKE they stake and the overall demand for the pool.\n\n\nAnother use case of CAKE is governance, which allows users to vote on important decisions related to the Pancakeswap platform. Users who hold CAKE tokens can participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the platform. The votes of CAKE holders are weighted based on the amount of CAKE they hold, and the outcomes of the votes are used to make decisions about the platform.\n\n\nFinally, CAKE is used for liquidity provision on Pancakeswap. Users can provide liquidity to the platform by adding their CAKE and other tokens to liquidity pools. In return, they receive a share of the trading fees and can earn rewards in the form of CAKE. The demand for CAKE is driven by the need for liquidity on the platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.\n\n\n### Criteria for listing Tokens\n\nThere are a few general criteria that a token must meet in order to be listed on PancakeSwap. These include:\n\n* The token must be built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n* The token must have a functional product or service.\n* The token must have a transparent and active team behind it.\n* The token must have a clear and reasonable token economics model.\n* The token must not engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities.\n\nIf a token meets these criteria, it can potentially be listed on PancakeSwap. However, it is important to note that PancakeSwap has the final say on whether or not a token will be listed on the platform.\n"

          "details": "#### What is Sushi?\nSushi is a decentralized organization that aims to solve the liquidity problem in the decentralized market. The liquidity problem refers to the difficulty of connecting different forms of liquidity with decentralized markets and vice versa. Sushi aims to create a range of network effects through its various decentralized markets and instruments, rather than just focusing on a single solution. These instruments include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, an auction platform, an AMM framework, and staking derivatives. Sushi's products are designed to maintain decentralized governance through the use of $SUSHI tokens, while also allowing for innovation and decision-making by the core team.\n\n\n### Products\n\n#### BentoBox\n\nThe BentoBox, also known as Bento, is a unique feature of Sushi. It is a token vault that generates yield for deposited capital through low-risk farming strategies. Bento tracks the user's deposits through artificial balance, which allows the funds to be simultaneously applied to various strategies while being accounted for as idle. These strategies can include depositing tokens on Compound for lending yield or serving up $SUSHI on the SushiBar to earn more $SUSHI. The BentoBox can also be used for flash loans, which can increase the value of the user's idle capital. The BentoBox serves as the foundation for all of Sushi's financial instruments, allowing users to utilize their tokens in various ways on the platform.\n\n\n#### Kashi Lending\n\nKashi is a lending and margin trading platform, built on the BentoBox, that allows users to create customized and gas-efficient markets for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stable coins, and synthetic assets. It uses a unique isolated market framework that supports a diverse range of tokens. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, each market on Kashi is isolated, meaning that the risk of assets within one lending market does not affect the risk of another lending market.\n\n\nThis design enables users to add any token to the platform, as the risk of each market is isolated. It also allows users to achieve leverage in a single click, as lending and borrowing in the same market are composable. In the past, users seeking leverage on an asset would have had to borrow on one platform and lend on another, but Kashi's design allows for this process to be automated in a single click. Overall, Kashi Lending aims to provide a flexible and efficient platform for lending and borrowing in the decentralized market.\n\n\n#### Limit Order V2\n\nLimit Order v2 is a feature on Sushi's decentralized exchange that allows users to place limit orders on the platform. A limit order is a type of order that allows the user to specify a certain price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. If the market price of the asset reaches the specified price, the order will be filled. Limit Order v2 is an updated version of the original limit order feature, with improvements that aim to increase efficiency and reduce gas costs.\n\n\nOne of the main improvements in Limit Order v2 is the use of a \"virtual balance\" system. This system allows users to place limit orders without actually holding the asset they are trying to buy or sell. Instead, the virtual balance is used to track the user's intended trade and the order is filled when the market price reaches the specified price. This system reduces gas costs and allows users to place limit orders more efficiently.\n\n\nAdditionally, Limit Order v2 introduces a new feature called \"order batching,\" which allows multiple orders to be processed together in a single transaction. This reduces gas costs and increases the speed of order processing. Overall, Limit Order v2 aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for users to place limit orders on the Sushi decentralized exchange.\n\n\n#### Masterchef v2\n\nMasterchef v2 is a feature that allows users to automate the creation of liquidity pools on SushiSwap. A liquidity pool is a pool of assets that users can contribute in exchange for a share of the trading fees. By automating the creation of liquidity pools, Masterchef v2 aims to make it easier for users to provide liquidity and earn rewards on the platform.\n\n\nMasterchef v2 introduces several improvements over the original Masterchef feature, including the ability to create liquidity pools for any ERC-20 token and the ability to adjust the weight of each asset in the pool. It also introduces a new feature called \"flex pools,\" which allow users to provide liquidity for multiple assets within a single pool. This allows users to earn rewards on multiple assets at once, rather than having to create separate pools for each asset. Overall, Masterchef v2 aims to provide a more flexible and efficient way for users to provide liquidity on the SushiSwap platform.\n\n\n#### SushiSwap\n\nSushiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and tokens. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model for pricing and liquidity. AMM exchanges do not have traditional order books, but rather use algorithmic pricing based on the supply and demand of assets in the exchange.\n\n\nOne of the key features of SushiSwap is its liquidity pools, which allow users to provide liquidity in exchange for a share of the trading fees. Users can contribute assets to a liquidity pool and receive a share of the pool proportional to their contribution. These pools provide liquidity for trades on the SushiSwap DEX and allow users to earn rewards for providing liquidity.\n\n\nSushiSwap also includes a feature called \"SushiBar,\" which allows users to earn yield on their idle tokens by serving them up for others to use in trades on the DEX. SushiSwap aims to provide a decentralized and efficient platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\n#### Trident AMM Framework\n\nTrident is a framework for building and deploying automated market makers (AMMs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional AMMs, which are hard-coded pools with specific features, Trident is a framework that allows users to create any type of AMM they desire. It is based on the concept of \"interface-based programming,\" which allows developers to rapidly and collectively build new AMM pool types using a single interface called the IPool interface.\n\n\nTrident includes several features that aim to improve the efficiency and flexibility of AMMs. These include the ability to create dynamic liquidity types, the ability to prevent counterproductive game theoretics, and the ability to enable external developers to engineer high volume pools. It also includes a feature called the Trident Pipeline, which is a set of additional AMM pool types that are currently in development. These pool types include Concentrated and Index pools, which are designed to provide specialized liquidity for specific asset classes.\n\n\nIt is intended to be a framework that any AMM can build on top of, and can synergize with, in order to create a more efficient and flexible AMM ecosystem.\n\n\n#### Rewards\n\nYield farming is a term used in the cryptocurrency world to describe the process of earning a yield (or return) on your investment through a variety of methods, such as lending, staking, or providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX). In the context of Sushi, yield farming refers specifically to the process of earning returns on your investments in certain liquidity pools (or \"farms\") within the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nSushiSwap pools allow liquidity providers to add their tokens to liquidity pools. When they do so they will receive SLP tokens (Sushiswap Liquidity Provider tokens) for example if a user deposited $SUSHI and $ETH into a pool they would receive SUSHI-ETH SLP tokens.\n\n\nThese tokens represent a proportional share of the pooled assets, allowing a user to reclaim their funds at any point. As an LP its important to understand that you may be exposed to \"Impermanent Loss\" when providing liquidity. However, as a liquidity provider you will also receive trade fee reward.\n\n\n* Every time a user trades between $SUSHI and $ETH a 0.3% fee is taken on the trade. 0.25% of that trade goes back to the the LP pool.\n* If previously there were 100 SLP tokens representing 100 ETH and 100 SUSHI each token would be worth 1 ETH & 1 SRM. \n* If one user trade 10 ETH for 10 SUSHI, and another traded 10 SUSHI for 10 ETH, then there would now be 100.025 ETH and 100.025 SUSHI.\n* This means each LP token would be worth 1.00025 ETH and 1.00025 SUSHI now when it is withdrawn.\n* If you are farming on the farms, you will still get the 0.25% reward fee for being an LP when you next remove your liquidity.\n\n\n##### SushiBar\n\nThe SushiBar is a feature within the Sushi protocol that allows users to earn a yield by providing liquidity to certain pools. When users contribute liquidity to a pool, they earn a share of the fees generated by the pool in proportion to their contribution. These fees are paid in the form of SUSHI, the native token of the Sushi protocol.\n\n##### OnSen\n\nThe Onsen is a feature within the Sushi protocol that allows users to earn a yield by staking their SUSHI. When users stake their SUSHI, they earn a share of the fees generated by the Sushi protocol in proportion to their stake. These fees are also paid in SUSHI.\n"

          "key": "sushi-tokens",
          "details": "#### SUSHI\n\nSUSHI is the native token of the Sushi protocol. It is used as a medium of exchange within the Sushi protocol and can be bought, sold, and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\nSUSHI has a number of features and functions within the Sushi protocol. It is used to pay fees on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange, which is built on top of the Sushi protocol. When users make trades on SushiSwap, a 0.3% fee is charged. This fee is paid in SUSHI and is used to support the operation and development of the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nSUSHI is also used as the primary token for governance on the Sushi protocol. SUSHI holders can participate in decision-making processes related to the protocol by voting on proposals using their SUSHI. This allows the community to have a say in the direction and development of the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nIn addition to its role as a medium of exchange and for governance, SUSHI can also be earned through yield farming on the Sushi protocol.The Sushi protocol includes features such as the SushiBar and the Onsen, which allow users to earn a yield on their investments by providing liquidity or staking their SUSHI, respectively.\n\n#### xSushi\n\nxSUSHI is a token issued by the Sushi protocol. It is designed to be a way for users to earn a yield on their investments in the Sushi protocol by providing liquidity through the SushiBar.\n\n\nTo earn xSUSHI, users must first purchase SUSHI, the native token of the Sushi protocol, and then deposit it into the SushiBar. When users contribute liquidity to the SushiBar, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return. These LP tokens represent a share of the pool and entitle the holder to a share of the fees generated by the pool.\n\n\nFees are generated on SushiSwap, which is built on top of the Sushi protocol. When users make trades on SushiSwap, a 0.3% fee is charged. 0.05% of this fee is added to the SushiBar pool in the form of LP tokens. These LP tokens are then sold for SUSHI on the SushiSwap DEX, and the newly purchased SUSHI is distributed to XSUSHI holders in proportion to their stake.\n\n\nThis process is repeated on a regular basis, with the rewards contract being called at least once per day. As a result, the value of XSUSHI is expected to increase over time as it accrues value from platform fees in addition to the underlying value of SUSHI. The value of XSUSHI is also linked to the value of SUSHI, as the fees that are distributed to the SushiBar are paid in SUSHI. However, the value of XSUSHI is typically higher than the value of SUSHI, as it accrues value from platform fees in addition to the underlying value of SUSHI.\n\n#### Criteria for listing tokens\n\nSome general factors that may be considered when evaluating a token for listing on SushiSwap: \n\n* **Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements**: Tokens must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in order to be listed on SushiSwap. This may include requirements related to securities laws, anti-money laundering regulations, and other relevant rules and regulations.\n\n* **Quality and security of the token**: Tokens must have a well-designed and secure smart contract in order to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may also consider the overall quality and stability of the token and its underlying technology.\n\n* **Community support and adoption**: Tokens that have strong community support and adoption may be more likely to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may consider the size and engagement of a token's community as well as the level of interest in the token among potential users.\n\n* **Transparency and openness**: Tokens that are transparent and open about their development, governance, and other key aspects may be more likely to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may consider factors such as the transparency of the token's project roadmap and the openness of its governance processes.\n"
