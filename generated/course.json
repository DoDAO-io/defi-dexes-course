      "details": "A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority. This means that it is not owned or controlled by a single entity, and instead relies on a decentralized network of computers to facilitate trades.\n\nSome benefits of decentralized exchanges include:\n\n1. Censorship resistance: Because decentralized exchanges are not controlled by a single entity, they are resistant to censorship. This means that users can trade freely without the risk of their transactions being blocked or reversed.\n2. Increased security: Decentralized exchanges do not hold users' funds, which means that there is a lower risk of funds being stolen or hacked.\n3. Privacy: Decentralized exchanges do not require users to provide personal information, which means that trades can be conducted privately.\n4. Accessibility: Decentralized exchanges can be accessed from anywhere in the world, as long as the user has an internet connection.\n5. Improved accessibility: Decentralized exchanges are often easier to use and more accessible than centralized exchanges, as they do not require users to go through a lengthy registration process.\n6. Greater control: Users have greater control over their assets on a decentralized exchange, as they are in charge of managing their own private keys.\n7. Lower fees: Decentralized exchanges often have lower fees than centralized exchanges, as they do not need to cover the costs of maintaining a central infrastructure.\n\nIn this chapter we are going to \n1. Understand why exchanges are need and why people exchange tokens\n2. We then look at new way of exchanging tokens i.e. without the need of another party to perform the exchange\n3.

          "details": "## Exchange of Goods\nThe exchanging of goods has been an important part of society since the beginning of time. Users have been buying and \nselling stocks for centuries in different economies with a strong financial system that allows them to buy and hold any \ntype of asset. Only a digital representation is necessary for users to trade an asset in markets. The number of \nparticipants affects the volatility of the asset and the overall stability of the financial system. More number of \nparticipants lead to a more stable system.\n\n## Stock Exchanges\nStock exchanges play a vital role in the functioning of the global economy, as they provide a way for companies to \nraise capital and for investors to buy and sell stocks.\n\nStock exchanges provide a platform for companies to raise capital by selling stocks to the public. Investors can buy \nstocks in companies that they believe will be successful, with the expectation that the value of the stocks will \nincrease over time. Stock exchanges also provide a way for investors to sell their stocks if they need to or want \nto realize their profits.\n\n## Blockchain Token\nBlockchain tokens can represent a wide variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, \nand more. Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that can be used as a medium of exchange. They are native \nto a certain blockchain project and act as a way to fuel that project. Many projects enable certain functionality if \nusers hold the native currency of the project. For example, a user might need some of the project's currency to be \nable to access certain features on the platform.\n\nSo what exactly are utility tokens? Utility tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that gives users access to a \nproduct or service. They are often used to fund new blockchain projects. And last but not least, security tokens are \na type of cryptocurrency that represents an investment in a company or asset. They give investors ownership rights \nand can be traded on secondary markets.\n\nBlockchain tokens can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges, and their value is determined by supply \nand demand. Some people buy blockchain tokens as a long-term investment, while others buy and sell them for \nshort-term profits.\n\n## Token Exchange\nThere are many reasons why people might exchange crypto tokens, and these reasons are similar to why people might exchange stocks:\n\n1. Investment: Some people buy crypto tokens as a long-term investment, hoping that the value of the token will increase over time.\n2. Speculation: Some people buy crypto tokens with the intention of selling them for a profit in the short-term, similar to day trading.\n3. Use as a medium of exchange: Crypto tokens can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, similar to fiat currency.\n4. Diversification: Some people may buy crypto tokens as a way to diversify their investment portfolio.\n\nAlong with these reasons, people would want to exchange tokens because of the utility associated with them. For example, \npeople might want to get tokens to be able to vote on a proposal, to pay gas fees, or to stake for rewards."

          "details": "## Introduction to Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\nCentralized exchanges took a big hit in 2022 when a lot of them went bankrupt, leaving customers without their \nhard-earned funds. On the other hand, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) proved to be more resilient and trustworthy \nduring this time.\n\nDEXs are at the heart of DeFi, so to get a good grasp of how DeFi works, it's important to understand DEXs well.\n\n\n## Stock Exchanges\nThere is at least one centralized exchange in every country where users can buy and sell stocks or other financial products.\nSince the centralized banking ecosystem is very well mature, we don't interact with them directly. We normally use the \ntrading account of our bank to place buy or sell orders on these exchanges.\n\nThe main functions of a stock exchange include:\n1. Providing a platform for the buying and selling of securities: A stock exchange allows investors to buy and sell securities through an organized and regulated marketplace.\n2. Setting listing requirements: A stock exchange has rules and regulations that companies must follow in order to be listed on the exchange and have their securities traded.\n3. Disseminating price information: A stock exchange provides real-time price quotes for the securities traded on the exchange, which helps investors make informed investment decisions.\n4. Providing liquidity: By bringing together buyers and sellers in a centralized marketplace, a stock exchange helps to increase the liquidity of securities, making it easier for investors to buy and sell them.\n5. Promoting transparency: A stock exchange helps to promote transparency in the financial markets by requiring listed companies to disclose financial information and other important information to the public.\n6. Regulating market participants: A stock exchange is responsible for enforcing rules and regulations that govern the behavior of market participants, including brokers, traders, and issuers of securities.\n\n## Centralized Crypto Exchanges\nCentralized crypto exchanges are similar to traditional centralized stock exchanges, but they aren't always \nregulated and they don't necessarily provide transparency when it comes to their reserves and liabilities. \n\nHowever, these exchanges make it easy for users to get exposure to cryptocurrency by integrating with banks and making \nit easy to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency or vice versa. Additionally, users don't have to deal with the hassle \nof managing private keys for crypto wallets since they can simply use a normal email and password account on these \nexchanges.\n\nAs many centralized exchanges went under in 2022 and customers lost their funds, many people moved to decentralized \nexchanges where they could hold custody of their own funds. This proved to be a crucial year for decentralized exchanges, \nas they gained a lot of business from people looking for a more secure way to store their assets.\n\n## Decentralized Exchanges\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) are marketplaces that are run purely by smart contracts, without any human intervention. \nTransactions on DEXs are recorded on the blockchain, which allows for transparent and secure record-keeping. This means \nthat DEXs do not hold user funds; instead, users retain control of their own assets when trading on the platform.\n\nCentralized exchanges, on the other hand, are controlled by a single entity and typically hold users' funds in a \ncentralized wallet. This makes them vulnerable to outages, hacks, and other forms of interference.\n\nSome of the benefits of decentralized exchanges include:\n1. More reliable: Since DEXs do not hold users' funds and transactions are recorded on a blockchain, they are generally considered to be more secure than centralized exchanges.\n2. Greater resistance to censorship: DEXs are decentralized and do not rely on a central point of control, making them resistant to censorship. This can be important for users in countries with strict internet regulations or for traders looking to avoid having their transactions blocked by governments or financial institutions.\n3. More privacy: DEXs do not require users to provide personal information, making them a more private option for trading.\n4. Self Custody: With DEXs, users have full control over their assets as they retain possession of their private keys.\n5. Improved accessibility: DEXs can be accessed from any location, as they do not rely on a central server. This makes them more accessible to users in countries where centralized exchanges may be blocked."

          "shortTitle": "AMM",
          "details": "## Introduction to Automated Market Makers\nAMMs is the heart of Decentralized exchanges and \n\n\n## Automated Market Makers\nAn automated market maker (AMM) is a type of algorithm that operates as a decentralized exchange by setting prices and facilitating trades for a particular asset or group of assets. AMMs use a mathematical formula to determine the price of an asset based on the supply and demand for that asset. This allows them to operate without the need for a traditional order book, which is a list of buy and sell orders maintained by a centralized exchange.\n\nOne popular example of an AMM is the Uniswap protocol, which allows users to buy and sell a variety of cryptocurrencies using a mathematical formula to determine prices. AMMs can offer several benefits over traditional centralized exchanges, including greater security, improved accessibility, and reduced fees. However, they may not offer the same level of liquidity as centralized exchanges.\n## Constant Product Market Maker(CFMM) \nThe secret ingredient in AMMs is a mathematical formula that can take many  different forms. The most common one was proposed by Vitalik and popularized  by Uniswap. \nIt's the \n\n`\"x * y = k\"` \n\nformula also known as Constant Product Market Maker\nThe \"k\" in constant represents a equilibrium of assets that help to determine  the costs of tokens in a liquidity pool. For example, if an automated market maker(AMM) has  ether(ETH) and bitcoin(BTC), which are both volatile assets, then every time ETH is bought,  the price of ETH will go up because there is less ETH in the pool. However, the price of BTC will go down since there is more BTC in the pool. The pool always strives to maintain  a constant balance, where the total value of ETH in the pool is always equal to the total  value of BTC in the pool. It's only when new liquidity providers join that causes the  pool to expand in size.\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/defi-dexes-course/main/images/constant_product_amm.png\"\n  alt=\"Constant Product Market Maker\">\n  <figcaption>Constant Product Market Maker - Source: Dmitriy Berenzon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Other Type of AMMs Some other notable type of AMMs are \n### Constant Sum Market Makers\nThe Constant Sum Market Maker (CSMM) is one variation of the constant product equation,  which is represented as follows:\n\n`\"x+y = c\"` \n\nThis equation simply states that the sum of two variables must remain constant. However,  this approach is not profitable for any DEX because it cannot provide infinite liquidity. There  would always be a situation where one of the pool reserves would be emptied.\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/defi-dexes-course/main/images/constant_sum_amm.png\"\n  alt=\"Constant Sum Market Maker\">\n  <figcaption>Constant Sum Market Maker - Source: Dmitriy Berenzon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Hybrid Automated Market Makers \nCurve (a.k.a. Stableswap) came up with the idea that if the assets being traded are  relatively stable in price (e.g. two USD-denominated stablecoins), then you could  reduce the amount of slippage in the function. This insight has led to several projects  using hybrid functions to achieve desired properties based on the characteristics of the  assets being traded. Here is the formula\n\n$$\n\nA \\cdot n^n \\cdot \\sum{x_i} +D = A \\cdot D \\cdot n^n + { \\frac{D^{n+1}}{{n}^{n}\\cdot \\prod{x_i} } }\n\n$$\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/defi-dexes-course/main/images/curve.png\"\n  alt=\"Constant Sum Market Maker\">\n  <figcaption>Source: Curve Whitepaper</figcaption>\n</figure>",

          "shortTitle": "Introduction",
          "key": "pancake-introduction",
          "details": "Pancakeswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform designed to support **high-speed transactions** and **low fees**. Pancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n### How Does Pancakeswap Work?\n\nPancakeswap is built on the Binance Smart Chain, which utilizes the same technology as the Binance Chain but includes additional features such as smart contracts. This allows Pancakeswap to offer a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, and trading.\n\nUsers can access Pancakeswap through a web browser or through a compatible wallet such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Once connected, users can browse the available assets and trade them on the exchange. Pancakeswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, which means that users don't have to wait for their orders to be matched with other buyers or sellers. Instead, the AMM algorithm calculates the price of each asset based on the supply and demand of the market.\n\n### Binance Smart Chain\n\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network developed by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that it can run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) that are built on Ethereum.\n\n\nBSC was designed to offer the benefits of Ethereum's smart contract functionality, while also providing faster transaction speeds and lower fees. It uses a **proof-of-staked-authority** (PoSA) consensus mechanism, which means that block validation is performed by a group of validators who have staked a certain amount of the Binance Coin (BNB) cryptocurrency.\n\n\nBSC has its own native cryptocurrency, called **Binance Coin** (BNB), which is used to pay transaction fees on the network. It also supports a wide range of other cryptocurrency assets, including those built on Ethereum and other networks.\n\n\n### Also Available on Aptos\n\n\nPancakeSwap announced its decision to deploy its native multichain proposal, which saw the CAKE token distributed on the Aptos blockchain. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the move, with around 99% of the votes in favor. \n\n\nThe PancakeSwap team cited the low transaction costs and speed of transactions on the Aptos blockchain as the main reasons for this decision. \n\n\nThe deployment of PancakeSwap on Aptos included four main features: exchanges, farms, pools, and initial farm offerings. The CAKE token was also natively available on the Aptos blockchain. The deployment took place in two phases, with phase 1 focusing on liquidity extraction programs and phase 2 launching ramps for new projects. PancakeSwap worked closely with the Aptos team to ensure a smooth deployment, with all four key products expected to be available by the end of November. \n\n\nThere was no change to the CAKE tokenomics, but the distribution of CAKE emissions between the two chains was managed by the PancakeSwap team in a way that promoted the burning of more CAKE. \n\n\nThere have been criticisms of Aptos in the past, including a lack of initial transparency, misleading advertising, and a large allocation of VC tokens to developers and private investors. However, PancakeSwap believes that the project has the potential to be improved continuously.\n\n\n### The Exchange\n\n\nPancakeswap allows users to buy, sell, and trade a wide range of cryptocurrency assets, including popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as lesser-known altcoins and NFTs. Users can view the available assets and their prices on the Pancakeswap exchange, and can place orders to buy or sell using the AMM algorithm.\n\n\nOne of the key features of Pancakeswap is its liquidity pools, which allow users to provide liquidity to the exchange in exchange for a share of the fees generated by the trades. This helps to ensure that there is always a healthy supply of assets available for trading and allows users to earn a passive income by providing liquidity.\n\n\n### Syrup Pools \n\nOne of the unique features of Pancakeswap is its syrup pools. These are liquidity pools that allow users to provide liquidity to the platform in exchange for a share of the trading fees. Staking in Syrup Pools lets you earn CAKE or other tokens while you sleep!\n\n\nIt's simpler than farming with PancakeSwap's Yield Farms because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake one token to start earning: usually CAKE.\n\n\nPancakeSwap now offers one CAKE Syrup Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking.\n\n\n**Flexible staking** allows users to stake their CAKE and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. There is a small **unstaking fee of 0.1%** within the first **72 hours** of staking and a **performance fee of 2%** that is subtracted automatically from each yield harvest. The CAKE collected via these fees is burned every week as part of the regular CAKE token burns.\n\n\n**Fixed-term staking** allows users to maximize their yield by locking their staked CAKE for a period of time in exchange for a linearly boosted yield compared to flexible staking. There are **no performance fees** for fixed-term staking, and the longer the lock period, the higher the boost applied to the yield. CAKE rewards will be locked along with the staked CAKE until the staking duration ends, and once staked in fixed-term staking, users cannot withdraw until the end of their lock duration. In addition to higher yields, fixed-term staking also offers additional benefits such as boosted voting power, boosted farm yields, and priority access to IFO public sales and special events.\n\n\nBoth flexible staking and fixed-term staking are part of the same pool, allowing users to easily migrate between the two options. However, once CAKE is staked in fixed-term staking, users can perform flexible staking on the side. The CAKE Syrup Pool is a great way for users to earn more CAKE and take advantage of the additional benefits offered through fixed-term staking.\n\n\n### Rewards\n\n\nYield farming on PancakeSwap is a way for users to earn the platform's native token, CAKE, by providing liquidity to the DEX's liquidity pools and staking liquidity provider (LP) tokens in yield farms. When a user provides liquidity to a liquidity pool, they receive LP tokens that represent their share of the pool. These LP tokens can then be staked in a yield farm to earn CAKE rewards.\n\n\nThe **annual percentage rate** (APR) earned through yield farming on PancakeSwap is made up of two components: the LP rewards APR earned through providing liquidity, and the farm base rewards APR earned by staking LP tokens in the farm. By staking LP tokens in a farm, users can earn CAKE rewards while still maintaining a position in their other tokens.\n\n\nTo calculate the farm base reward APR, the farm multiplier and the total amount of liquidity in the farm are used. The farm base APR is the amount of CAKE (the native token of PancakeSwap) distributed to the farm.\n\n\nTo calculate the LP reward APR, the yearly fees earned by the pool are divided by the liquidity. For example, let's say there is $387.42M in liquidity and the 24-hour volume is $96.97M. The fee share of liquidity providers in the pool can be calculated by multiplying the 24-hour volume by the trading fee structure (0.17% in this case): $96,970,000 * 0.17 / 100 = $164,849. The projected yearly fees earned by the pool can then be calculated by multiplying this fee share by the number of days in a year: $164,849 * 365 = $60,169,885. Finally, the LP rewards APR can be calculated by dividing the yearly fees by the liquidity: ($60,169,885 / $387,420,000) * 100 = 15.53% LP reward APR.\n\n\nUnlike Syrup Pools, Farms require you to stake two tokens to get LP Tokens, which you then stake in the Farm to earn rewards. This lets you earn CAKE while still keeping a position in your other tokens!\n\n\nIt is important to note that yield farming on PancakeSwap with a risk of impermanent loss. This occurs when the value of the tokens in the liquidity pool changes over time, leading to a difference between the value of the tokens when they were added to the pool and their value when they are withdrawn. This can result in a loss for the liquidity provider, even if the value of the tokens they received as a reward has increased.\n\n\n### StableSwap\n\n\nStableSwap is a feature on PancakeSwap, that allows users to trade stablecoin pairs with **lower slippage**. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. StableSwap uses an invariant curve slippage function to achieve this, which helps to keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is not extremely unbalanced.\n\n\nStableSwap is implemented using an automated market maker (AMM) model developed by Curve Finance, which utilizes liquidity pools to match buy and sell orders for a particular asset. The AMM model used by StableSwap includes a **linear invariant constant sum curve** in addition to the constant product formula used in normal AMMs. This helps to reduce impermanent loss, which occurs when the price of an asset changes while it is being held in a liquidity pool, and lowers the slippage compared to normal AMMs that use only the constant product formula.\n\n\nStableSwap is designed to swap specific assets that are priced closely, such as USD stablecoins like HAY, BUSD, and USDT, or liquid staking tokens like stkBNB and aBNBc. When using StableSwap, users will pay **lower trading fees** compared to the standard 0.25% fee on normal PancakeSwap AMMs.\n\n### Lottery V2\n\n\nAnother popular feature of Pancakeswap is the lottery V2. It allows users to purchase lottery tickets using BSC tokens. The winners are chosen randomly, and the prizes can be anything from tokens to NFTs. The lottery V2 has become very popular on Pancakeswap, as it allows users to try their luck at winning a portion of the lottery's prize pool. The size of the prize pool depends on the number of tickets sold and the amount of BNB or CAKE that is wagered.\n\n\n### Prediction\n\n\nPancakeswap also has a prediction feature that allows users to make predictions on the future value of different tokens. The users who make the most accurate predictions are rewarded with tokens. This feature has become very popular on Pancakeswap as it allows users to test their knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and potentially earn some rewards.\n\n\n### Pottery\n\n\nPottery is a yield farming strategy on PancakeSwap that allows users to earn CAKE, the platform's native token, by depositing CAKE and participating in a lottery-style drawing. To participate in Pottery, users must deposit a **minimum of 1 CAKE** on the Pottery page during a specified period, which occurs on the **Friday before the first Monday of each month**. The deposited CAKE is directed to a lock-staking pool and locked for **ten weeks**. During this time, **80%** of the total staking rewards generated from the deposited CAKE are directed to a prize pool for weekly drawings, and the remaining **20%** are reserved for withdrawal after the ten weeks are complete. With Pottery, you will be guaranteed to get back 100% of what you deposited in 10 weeks. However, you can only withdraw your CAKE deposit after 10 weeks of locking, without any other way to withdraw early. The chance of winning a prize in the weekly drawings is determined by the size of the user's deposit relative to the overall pool. Pottery uses **Chainlink's implementation of VRF** (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure the security and randomness of the drawing process.\n\n\n### The NFT Marketplace\n\n\nPancakeswap has its own NFT marketplace where users can buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The NFTs on the platform are divided into different categories, such as art, collectibles, and gaming. In order to be considered for listing on PancakeSwap, an NFT collection must meet certain technical and business requirements. Technical requirements include following **BEP-721 standards**, being **100% minted**, and hosting metadata on a decentralized platform like **IPFS**. Business requirements include having an **active community**, a working **website** with detailed information about the collection, and **active social channels**. PancakeSwap will assess projects on a case-by-case basis, and may ask for additional due diligence information.\n\n\n### The NFT Profile System\n\n\nPancakeswap also has an NFT profile system that allows users to showcase their NFT collection. The NFT profile system allows users to display their NFTs in a virtual gallery, and other users can view and interact with the NFTs. The NFT profile system has become very popular on Pancakeswap, with users using it to show off their NFT collections and discover new NFTs.\n\n\n### Initial Farm Offerings\n\nPancakeswap also has initial farm offerings (IFOs) that allow users to earn tokens by providing liquidity to a new project. IFO is a way for the platform to raise funds and create initial liquidity for the CAKE token. The IFOs on Pancakeswap are usually open for a limited time, and users who provide liquidity during the IFO period are rewarded with tokens. Pancakeswap uses a \"dutch auction\" format for its IFOs. This means that the price of CAKE decreases over time until the IFO ends, and users can purchase CAKE at the lowest price reached during the IFO. This allows users to purchase CAKE at a discount compared to the price it will be traded at once the IFO ends.\n"

          "title": "CAKE Token",
          "shortTitle": "CAKE",
          "key": "cake-token",
          "details": "CAKE is a cryptocurrency token that is used on the Pancakeswap decentralized exchange (DEX). It is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token and is used for a variety of purposes on the Pancakeswap platform, including staking, governance, and liquidity provision.\n\n\nThe total supply of CAKE is capped at 750 million tokens, and the tokens are distributed through various means, such as liquidity provision, staking, farming, and airdrops. The demand for CAKE is driven by its various use cases on the Pancakeswap platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.\n\n\nSome uses cases of CAKE are:\n* One of the main use cases of CAKE is staking, which allows users to earn a share of the trading fees on the Pancakeswap platform. Users can stake their CAKE tokens in liquidity pools or farm pools to earn a share of the fees. The amount of CAKE that users earn depends on the amount of CAKE they stake and the overall demand for the pool.\n* Another use case of CAKE is governance, which allows users to vote on important decisions related to the Pancakeswap platform. Users who hold CAKE tokens can participate in governance by voting on proposals that affect the platform. The votes of CAKE holders are weighted based on the amount of CAKE they hold, and the outcomes of the votes are used to make decisions about the platform.\n* Finally, CAKE is used for liquidity provision on Pancakeswap. Users can provide liquidity to the platform by adding their CAKE and other tokens to liquidity pools. In return, they receive a share of the trading fees and can earn rewards in the form of CAKE. The demand for CAKE is driven by the need for liquidity on the platform, as well as the overall demand for BSC tokens.\n\n\n### iCAKE\n\n\niCake is a numerical metric used by the PancakeSwap Initial Farm Offering (IFO) system to determine the maximum commit limit in IFO public sales. It is not a new token, but rather a way to reward loyal CAKE holders with increased IFO benefits. iCake is based on the number of CAKE staked in the fixed-term CAKE staking pool and the total staking duration of the user's current fixed-term staking position.\n\n\nThe number of iCake a user has is determined by a staking duration threshold. If the user's staking duration is above the threshold, the number of iCake they have is equal to the number of CAKE in their staking position. If the staking duration is below the threshold, the number of iCake is linearly decreased and adjusted. If the staking position is ended, the number of iCake is set to zero. The threshold is adjusted by PancakeSwap based on the average staking duration of the fixed-term staking CAKE pool between each IFO.\n\n\nIn addition to the introduction of iCake, PancakeSwap is also bringing improvements to the IFO experience and updates to the fixed-term CAKE staking pool. The upcoming IFO will include the use of iCake to calculate the maximum CAKE commit limit and a token vesting feature, which releases tokens from IFO sales over a period of time rather than all at once. This helps promote stability and community engagement by preventing a large supply shock.\n\n\nOverall, iCake is an important feature of the PancakeSwap platform that rewards loyal CAKE holders and helps to promote stability and community engagement in the IFO process.\n\n\n### vCAKE\n\n\nvCake is a numerical metric used by the PancakeSwap platform to represent the boosted voting power of a user based on their fixed-term CAKE staking position. It is not a new token, but rather a way to reward fixed-term CAKE holders with increased voting power. vCake is calculated based on the amount of CAKE staked in the fixed-term staking pool and the remaining lock duration of the staking position.\n\n\nIf the remaining staking duration is less than one week, the user's vCake is equal to the amount of CAKE staked in the pool. If the staking duration is more than one week, the vCake is equal to the amount of CAKE staked multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position. For example, if a user has staked 100 CAKE for 52 weeks and their staking position will unlock in 40 weeks, they would have 4000 vCake.\n\n\nvCake is an important feature of the PancakeSwap platform that rewards fixed-term CAKE holders and helps to promote stability and community engagement in the governance process. It was introduced through a 72-hour vote on the platform. Overall, vCake is expected to bring benefits to both fixed-term CAKE stakers and the overall CAKE ecosystem.\n\n\n### bCAKE\n\nbCAKE is a feature on PancakeSwap that allows users to boost the yield of their liquidity farming by staking fixed-term CAKE. bCAKE is not a new token, but rather a series of boost multipliers that can be applied to selected liquidity farms on PancakeSwap. The multipliers are calculated based on various metrics, including the number of CAKE staked in the fixed-term position, the duration of the staking position, and the number of LP tokens staked in the farm. Global metrics, such as the total amount of CAKE locked in the staking pool and the average lock duration, are also taken into account in the calculation. \n\n\nbCAKE can be easily activated by staking CAKE and then using the farm booster feature on the PancakeSwap farm page. Initially, bCAKE will only be available for the CAKE/BUSD farm and will have a maximum boost of 2x. However, the PancakeSwap team plans to expand the feature to other farms and increase the maximum boost in the future.\n\n\n### Criteria for listing Tokens\n\nThere are a few general criteria that a token must meet in order to be listed on PancakeSwap. These include:\n\n* The token must be built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n* The token must have a functional product or service.\n* The token must have a transparent and active team behind it.\n* The token must have a clear and reasonable token economics model.\n* The token must not engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities.\n\nIf a token meets these criteria, it can potentially be listed on PancakeSwap. However, it is important to note that PancakeSwap has the final say on whether or not a token will be listed on the platform.\n"

          "shortTitle": "Introduction",
          "key": "sushi-introduction",
          "details": "#### What is Sushi?\nSushi is a decentralized organization that aims to solve the liquidity problem in the decentralized market. The liquidity problem refers to the difficulty of connecting different forms of liquidity with decentralized markets and vice versa. Sushi aims to create a range of network effects through its various decentralized markets and instruments, rather than just focusing on a single solution. These instruments include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, an auction platform, an AMM framework, and staking derivatives. Sushi's products are designed to maintain decentralized governance through the use of $SUSHI tokens, while also allowing for innovation and decision-making by the core team.\n\n\n### Products\n\n#### BentoBox\n\nThe BentoBox, also known as Bento, is a unique feature of Sushi. It is a token vault that generates yield for deposited capital through low-risk farming strategies. Bento tracks the user's deposits through artificial balance, which allows the funds to be simultaneously applied to various strategies while being accounted for as idle. These strategies can include depositing tokens on Compound for lending yield or serving up $SUSHI on the SushiBar to earn more $SUSHI. The BentoBox can also be used for flash loans, which can increase the value of the user's idle capital. The BentoBox serves as the foundation for all of Sushi's financial instruments, allowing users to utilize their tokens in various ways on the platform.\n\n\n#### Kashi Lending\n\nKashi is a lending and margin trading platform, built on the BentoBox, that allows users to create customized and gas-efficient markets for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stable coins, and synthetic assets. It uses a unique isolated market framework that supports a diverse range of tokens. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, each market on Kashi is isolated, meaning that the risk of assets within one lending market does not affect the risk of another lending market.\n\n\nThis design enables users to add any token to the platform, as the risk of each market is isolated. It also allows users to achieve leverage in a single click, as lending and borrowing in the same market are composable. In the past, users seeking leverage on an asset would have had to borrow on one platform and lend on another, but Kashi's design allows for this process to be automated in a single click. Overall, Kashi Lending aims to provide a flexible and efficient platform for lending and borrowing in the decentralized market.\n\n\n#### Limit Order V2\n\nLimit Order v2 is a feature on Sushi's decentralized exchange that allows users to place limit orders on the platform. A limit order is a type of order that allows the user to specify a certain price at which they are willing to buy or sell an asset. If the market price of the asset reaches the specified price, the order will be filled. Limit Order v2 is an updated version of the original limit order feature, with improvements that aim to increase efficiency and reduce gas costs.\n\n\nOne of the main improvements in Limit Order v2 is the use of a \"virtual balance\" system. This system allows users to place limit orders without actually holding the asset they are trying to buy or sell. Instead, the virtual balance is used to track the user's intended trade and the order is filled when the market price reaches the specified price. This system reduces gas costs and allows users to place limit orders more efficiently.\n\n\nAdditionally, Limit Order v2 introduces a new feature called \"order batching,\" which allows multiple orders to be processed together in a single transaction. This reduces gas costs and increases the speed of order processing. Overall, Limit Order v2 aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for users to place limit orders on the Sushi decentralized exchange.\n\n\n#### Masterchef v2\n\nMasterchef v2 is a feature that allows users to automate the creation of liquidity pools on SushiSwap. A liquidity pool is a pool of assets that users can contribute in exchange for a share of the trading fees. By automating the creation of liquidity pools, Masterchef v2 aims to make it easier for users to provide liquidity and earn rewards on the platform.\n\n\nMasterchef v2 introduces several improvements over the original Masterchef feature, including the ability to create liquidity pools for any ERC-20 token and the ability to adjust the weight of each asset in the pool. It also introduces a new feature called \"flex pools,\" which allow users to provide liquidity for multiple assets within a single pool. This allows users to earn rewards on multiple assets at once, rather than having to create separate pools for each asset. Overall, Masterchef v2 aims to provide a more flexible and efficient way for users to provide liquidity on the SushiSwap platform.\n\n\n#### SushiSwap\n\nSushiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and tokens. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model for pricing and liquidity. AMM exchanges do not have traditional order books, but rather use algorithmic pricing based on the supply and demand of assets in the exchange.\n\n\nOne of the key features of SushiSwap is its liquidity pools, which allow users to provide liquidity in exchange for a share of the trading fees. Users can contribute assets to a liquidity pool and receive a share of the pool proportional to their contribution. These pools provide liquidity for trades on the SushiSwap DEX and allow users to earn rewards for providing liquidity.\n\n\nSushiSwap also includes a feature called \"SushiBar,\" which allows users to earn yield on their idle tokens by serving them up for others to use in trades on the DEX. SushiSwap aims to provide a decentralized and efficient platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\n#### Trident AMM Framework\n\nTrident is a framework for building and deploying automated market makers (AMMs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional AMMs, which are hard-coded pools with specific features, Trident is a framework that allows users to create any type of AMM they desire. It is based on the concept of \"interface-based programming,\" which allows developers to rapidly and collectively build new AMM pool types using a single interface called the IPool interface.\n\n\nTrident includes several features that aim to improve the efficiency and flexibility of AMMs. These include the ability to create dynamic liquidity types, the ability to prevent counterproductive game theoretics, and the ability to handle high volumes of transactions and liquidity. It is intended to be a framework that any AMM can build on top of, and can synergize with, in order to create a more efficient and flexible AMM ecosystem.\n\n\nThe IPool interface is at the heart of the Trident framework, and it includes methods like swap, flashSwap, mint, and burn. By programming to this interface, developers can create new and innovative pool types, such as those for trading decentralized options, stablecoins, or zero coupon bonds. The framework also allows for the integration of any future competitive AMMs into Trident, and for the creation of dynamic liquidity types. Additionally, developers can use the framework to prepare pool types to fit their own strategies and to prevent counterproductive game theoretics. External developers can also engineer high volume pools and earn fees from them.\n\n\nIn addition to the IPool interface, Trident also includes a pipeline of additional pool types that are currently in development. These include the Constant Product Pool, the Stable Pool, the Concentrated Pool, and the Index Pool. Each of these pools serves a different purpose and is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the IPool interface.\n\n\nThe Constant Product Pool is a type of AMM that maintains a constant product between the reserves of two different assets. This allows users to swap between these assets without affecting the overall liquidity of the pool. The Stable Pool, on the other hand, is designed to maintain stablecoin liquidity and allow users to swap between different stablecoins without affecting the overall liquidity of the pool.\n\n\nThe Concentrated Pool is a type of AMM that is designed to hold a large amount of a single asset, allowing users to trade it with high liquidity. The Index Pool is a type of AMM that is designed to track the price of a specific index or asset, allowing users to trade it with high liquidity.\n\n\nCurrently, the Trident framework is live on Polygon. In the future, the Trident team plans to expand the framework to other chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more.\n\n\n#### Rewards\n\nYield farming is a term used in the cryptocurrency world to describe the process of earning a yield (or return) on your investment through a variety of methods, such as lending, staking, or providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX). In the context of Sushi, yield farming refers specifically to the process of earning returns on your investments in certain liquidity pools (or \"farms\") within the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nSushiSwap pools allow liquidity providers to add their tokens to liquidity pools. When they do so they will receive SLP tokens (Sushiswap Liquidity Provider tokens) for example if a user deposited $SUSHI and $ETH into a pool they would receive SUSHI-ETH SLP tokens.\n\n\nThese tokens represent a proportional share of the pooled assets, allowing a user to reclaim their funds at any point. As an LP its important to understand that you may be exposed to \"Impermanent Loss\" when providing liquidity. However, as a liquidity provider you will also receive trade fee reward.\n\n\n* Every time a user trades between $SUSHI and $ETH a 0.3% fee is taken on the trade. 0.25% of that trade goes back to the the LP pool.\n* If previously there were 100 SLP tokens representing 100 ETH and 100 SUSHI each token would be worth 1 ETH & 1 SRM. \n* If one user trade 10 ETH for 10 SUSHI, and another traded 10 SUSHI for 10 ETH, then there would now be 100.025 ETH and 100.025 SUSHI.\n* This means each LP token would be worth 1.00025 ETH and 1.00025 SUSHI now when it is withdrawn.\n* If you are farming on the farms, you will still get the 0.25% reward fee for being an LP when you next remove your liquidity.\n\n\n##### SushiBar\n\nThe SushiBar is a feature within the Sushi protocol that allows users to earn a yield by providing liquidity to certain pools. When users contribute liquidity to a pool, they earn a share of the fees generated by the pool in proportion to their contribution. These fees are paid in the form of SUSHI, the native token of the Sushi protocol.\n\n##### OnSen\n\nThe Onsen is a feature within the Sushi protocol that allows users to earn a yield by staking their SUSHI. When users stake their SUSHI, they earn a share of the fees generated by the Sushi protocol in proportion to their stake. These fees are also paid in SUSHI.\n"

          "details": "#### SUSHI\n\nSUSHI is the native token of the Sushi protocol. It is used as a medium of exchange within the Sushi protocol and can be bought, sold, and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\nSUSHI has a number of features and functions within the Sushi protocol. It is used to pay fees on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange, which is built on top of the Sushi protocol. When users make trades on SushiSwap, a 0.3% fee is charged. This fee is paid in SUSHI and is used to support the operation and development of the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nSUSHI is also used as the primary token for governance on the Sushi protocol. SUSHI holders can participate in decision-making processes related to the protocol by voting on proposals using their SUSHI. This allows the community to have a say in the direction and development of the Sushi protocol.\n\n\nIn addition to its role as a medium of exchange and for governance, SUSHI can also be earned through yield farming on the Sushi protocol.The Sushi protocol includes features such as the SushiBar and the Onsen, which allow users to earn a yield on their investments by providing liquidity or staking their SUSHI, respectively.\n\n#### xSushi\n\nxSUSHI is a token issued by the Sushi protocol. It is designed to be a way for users to earn a yield on their investments in the Sushi protocol by providing liquidity through the SushiBar.\n\n\nTo earn xSUSHI, users must first purchase SUSHI, the native token of the Sushi protocol, and then deposit it into the SushiBar. When users contribute liquidity to the SushiBar, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return. These LP tokens represent a share of the pool and entitle the holder to a share of the fees generated by the pool.\n\n\nFees are generated on SushiSwap, which is built on top of the Sushi protocol. When users make trades on SushiSwap, a 0.3% fee is charged. 0.05% of this fee is added to the SushiBar pool in the form of LP tokens. These LP tokens are then sold for SUSHI on the SushiSwap DEX, and the newly purchased SUSHI is distributed to XSUSHI holders in proportion to their stake.\n\n\nThis process is repeated on a regular basis, with the rewards contract being called at least once per day. As a result, the value of XSUSHI is expected to increase over time as it accrues value from platform fees in addition to the underlying value of SUSHI. The value of XSUSHI is also linked to the value of SUSHI, as the fees that are distributed to the SushiBar are paid in SUSHI. However, the value of XSUSHI is typically higher than the value of SUSHI, as it accrues value from platform fees in addition to the underlying value of SUSHI.\n\n#### Criteria for listing tokens\n\nSome general factors that may be considered when evaluating a token for listing on SushiSwap: \n\n* **Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements**: Tokens must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in order to be listed on SushiSwap. This may include requirements related to securities laws, anti-money laundering regulations, and other relevant rules and regulations.\n\n* **Quality and security of the token**: Tokens must have a well-designed and secure smart contract in order to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may also consider the overall quality and stability of the token and its underlying technology.\n\n* **Community support and adoption**: Tokens that have strong community support and adoption may be more likely to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may consider the size and engagement of a token's community as well as the level of interest in the token among potential users.\n\n* **Transparency and openness**: Tokens that are transparent and open about their development, governance, and other key aspects may be more likely to be listed on SushiSwap. The exchange may consider factors such as the transparency of the token's project roadmap and the openness of its governance processes.\n"

          "details": "## Intro\nBalancer's smart pools use a constant mean formula which allows for more than two assets and weights outside of fifty-fifty, making it different from other pooling options. Balancer pools are able to include up to eight tokens at any number of weights. The constant mean formula also permits adaptive fee structures that can react to market forces like volatility or demand, giving projects the ability to experiment with liquidity.\n\n## Background\nFernando Martinelli, a well-known Brazilian entrepreneur and Maker Community member, founded Balancer. In 2018, he tested the exchange on Block as the first project of Balancer labs. In 2019, he and his technical colleague Nikolai Mushegian released the exchange's whitepaper. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) called Balancer enables customers to generate programmable liquidity. AMMs are decentralized exchanges where instead of the traditional order book method to trade assets smart contract acts as a partner in every trade. These contracts contain a cluster of tokens, called a liquidity pool. These liquidity pools ensure constant liquidity for buyers and sellers so they do not have to wait for orders to match.\n  \n\n## Features\nKey features of Balancer DEX include\n1. **Valut** - Vault is a smart contract that controls all tokens in every balancer pool. It also serves as the gateway through which most operations in the exchange (Swaps, market entries, and exits) are carried out.\n2. **Balancer Pools** - Balancer pools’ smart contracts determine how traders exchange tokens. They allow customization and also allows anybody to create a pool\n3. **Smart Order Router (SOR)** - SOR identifies the best price for selling and buying orders in a transaction in either one or multiple liquidity pools. It increases parallel to the expansion and diversity of the Balancer pools as it gets new options to check from.\n4. **veBAL** - BAL holders/LPs should lock/stake their BAL into veBAL to get a host of benefits in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.\n5. **Onchain Gauge System** - Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining.",

          "details": "Pools are the foundation of the Balancer Protocol and smart contracts that through which traders can swap between tokens on Balancer. What makes Balancer pools unique is their limitless flexibility; other exchanges have pools with constrained parameters, but Balancer can accommodate any composition or underlying math. This flexibility opens the door for customized pricing functions in trading pools.\n\n## Weighted Pools\nBalancer has about 1500 shared liquidity pools users can join. These pools can carry up to 8 assets and can have ratios other than the conventional 50-50 split. They range in size with the largest over a $37 million market cap. These pools use weighted maths and are called Weighted Pools. Weighted pools offer users the ability to choose their level of exposure to certain assets while still providing liquidity. This makes them a great choice for investors who want to diversify their portfolios without sacrificing liquidity. The higher a token's weight in a pool, the less impermanent loss it will experience in the event of a price surge. For example, [the Oracle Weighted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) with 80/20 ratio of BAL and WETH respectively. \n\n\n## Stable Pools\nStable Pools are created especially for assets like various stablecoins that are anticipated to regularly trade at close to parity. These use Stable Math (based on StableSwap, popularized by Curve) which allows for significantly larger trades before encountering substantial price impact, vastly increasing capital efficiency for like-kind swaps. These pools encounter lower price impacts. Since the stable pools are plugged into all the other pools on balancer swapping between stablecoins is frequently used for arbitrage when one token is paired with two different stable coins in different pools. The two largest stable tokens in use are for USD stablecoins and tokens that track Bitcoin that are [staBAL3-USD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) composed of DAI/USDC/USDT and [staBAL3-BTC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xfeadd389a5c427952d8fdb8057d6c8ba1156cc56000000000000000000000066) composed of WBTC/renBTC/sBTC.\n\n\n## Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools\nLBPs, or Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, are pools that have the ability to dynamically alter token weighting. Weighted Math with time-dependent weights is used in LBPs. The pool owner determines the starting and ending weights and times. The pool owner also has the authority to suspend swaps. This allows the users to incur less impermanent loss and allows the market to find the appropriate price for the new token. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are one of the most successful ways to launch a new token. The purpose of [Gitcoin's LBP](https://fjordfoundry.com/pools/mainnet/0xC065798F227b49C150bCDC6CDc43149A12c4d757), which is made up of AKITA and WETH, is to gradually return the Akita owned by the company (as given to it by Vitalik) to the community. When executing a slow sale with ongoing pressure, using an LBP is helpful. An example of LBP is [70/30/DAI/Temple](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xf88278315a1d5ace3aaa41712f60602e069208e6000200000000000000000375) pool\n\n\n## MetaStable Pools\nMetaStable Pools are an extension of Stable Pools that contain tokens with known exchange rates. Stable Math is used in conjunction with this established exchange rate in MetaStable Pools. They are great with tokens highly correlated but not pegged prices. For example, DAI/cDAI have a very strong correlation, but cDAI slowly accumulates lending fees by lending DAI to the Compound protocol and appreciates relative to DAI.  For example, Balancer MetaStable pools are ideal for the wstETH-WETH pair as the stETH asset is highly correlated but not pegged 1:1 to ETH as it accrues staking returns.\n\n\n## Managed Pools\nManaged Pools, which employ Weighted Math, let users create pools with a maximum of 50 tokens. These pools contain time-based weight-shifting methods akin to Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, giving a framework for fund managers. These pools are feature rich. Features include Pool Managers, active token management, etc. WSBDapp is utilizing Balancer's Managed Pools to bring decentralized finance to their users. This allows their investors to participate in pools created and operated by the WSBDapp Team using the technology and control only available on Balancer.\n\n\n## Boosted Pools\nBoosted Pools offer the best of both worlds to Liquidity Providers and Swappers. Swappers can access deep stablecoin liquidity with near-parity exchange rates, while Liquidity Providers can have their liquidity positions sent to external protocols, such as Aave. This is a great way for both groups to get what they need and make the most out of their situation. These variations of stable pools instead contain the pool tokens of nested linear pools, which, in the case of the Aave example, maintain the correct balances of TOKEN and aTOKEN.",
