    ## Features

    Key features of Balancer DEX include

    1. **Valut** - Vault is a smart contract that controls all tokens in every
    balancer pool. It also serves as the gateway through which most operations
    in the exchange (Swaps, market entries, and exits) are carried out.

    2. **Balancer Pools** - Balancer poolsâ€™ smart contracts determine how
    traders exchange tokens. They allow customization and also allows anybody to
    create a pool

    3. **Smart Order Router (SOR)** - SOR identifies the best price for selling
    and buying orders in a transaction in either one or multiple liquidity
    pools. It increases parallel to the expansion and diversity of the Balancer
    pools as it gets new options to check from.

    4. **veBAL** - BAL holders/LPs should lock/stake their BAL into veBAL to get
    a host of benefits in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.

    5. **Onchain Gauge System** - Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL
    emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs
    (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity mining.


    ## Vault

    The Vault is the smart contract used by Balancer. It is the smart contract
    that manages and holds all the tokens in a Balancer pool. It is also the
    portal through which most Balancer operations occur. It also separates
    accounting and token management from the pool logic. This architecture
    unifies several pool layouts under one roof; the Vault is agnostic to pool
    math and can support any system that meets a few criteria. This allows smart
    contracts much simpler as they now play a minor part in managing funds. If
    you have a great idea for a new trading system, you can create a custom pool
    that taps into Balancer's existing liquidity. This means you don't have to
    build your own decentralized exchange (DEX).


    Furthermore, other decentralized pools' token accounting is paired with pool
    logic which makes multi-hop trading quite costly since ERC-20 has to be
    transferred at each hop. Balancer gains an advantage here since it stores
    all its tokens under one contract, The Vault. This difference allows for
    much greater swapping efficiency. Rather than transferring tokens on each
    step of a multi-hop trade, it only keeps internal records of which pool is
    holding what, transferring tokens only at the input and output steps. This
    reduction in token transfers makes the entire process highly gas efficient.
    Additionally, The Vault keeps track of the balances for arbitrary Ethereum
    addresses. Users have access to the Vault where they can store Internal
    Balances and make trades to/from them.
