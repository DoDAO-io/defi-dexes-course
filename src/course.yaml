    title: Introduction
    details: >-
      A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that operates
      without a central authority. This means that it is not owned or controlled
      by a single entity, and instead relies on a decentralized network of
      computers to facilitate trades.


      Some benefits of decentralized exchanges include:


      1. Censorship resistance: Because decentralized exchanges are not
      controlled by a single entity, they are resistant to censorship. This
      means that users can trade freely without the risk of their transactions
      being blocked or reversed.

      2. Increased security: Decentralized exchanges do not hold users' funds,
      which means that there is a lower risk of funds being stolen or hacked.

      3. Privacy: Decentralized exchanges do not require users to provide
      personal information, which means that trades can be conducted privately.

      4. Accessibility: Decentralized exchanges can be accessed from anywhere in
      the world, as long as the user has an internet connection.

      5. Improved accessibility: Decentralized exchanges are often easier to use
      and more accessible than centralized exchanges, as they do not require
      users to go through a lengthy registration process.

      6. Greater control: Users have greater control over their assets on a
      decentralized exchange, as they are in charge of managing their own
      private keys.

      7. Lower fees: Decentralized exchanges often have lower fees than
      centralized exchanges, as they do not need to cover the costs of
      maintaining a central infrastructure.


      In this chapter we are going to 

      1. Understand why exchanges are need and why people exchange tokens

      2. We then look at new way of exchanging tokens i.e. without the need of
      another party to perform the exchange

      3. Different type of Automated Market Makers

    title: Uniswap
    details: >+
      Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum that allows
      users to exchange ERC-20 tokens. It was one of the first decentralized
      exchanges to gain widespread adoption and is known for its simplicity and
      ease of use. Unlike centralized exchanges, which match buyers and sellers
      and facilitate trades on their own platforms, Uniswap allows users to
      trade directly with one another without the need for an intermediary. This
      makes it easier for users to trade without the need to go through
      know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and
      without the risk of having their funds held by a centralized entity that
      could be hacked or go bankrupt.

    title: Balancer
    details: >
      Fernando Martinelli, a well-known Brazilian entrepreneur and Maker
      Community member, founded Balancer. In 2018, he tested the exchange on
      Block as the first project of Balancer labs. In 2019, he and his technical
      colleague Nikolai Mushegian released the exchange's whitepaper. An
      Automated Market Maker (AMM) called Balancer enables customers to generate
      programmable liquidity. AMMs are decentralized exchanges where instead of
      the traditional order book method to trade assets smart contract acts as a
      partner in every trade. These contracts contain a cluster of tokens,
      called a liquidity pool. These liquidity pools ensure constant liquidity
      for buyers and sellers so they do not have to wait for orders to match.
              
      Key features of Balancer DEX include

      1. **Valut** - Vault is a smart contract that controls all tokens in every
      balancer pool. It also serves as the gateway through which most operations
      in the exchange (Swaps, market entries, and exits) are carried out.

      2. **Balancer Pools** - Balancer poolsâ€™ smart contracts determine how
      traders exchange tokens. They allow customization and also allows anybody
      to create a pool

      3. **Smart Order Router (SOR)** - SOR identifies the best price for
      selling and buying orders in a transaction in either one or multiple
      liquidity pools. It increases parallel to the expansion and diversity of
      the Balancer pools as it gets new options to check from.

      4. **veBAL** - BAL holders/LPs should lock/stake their BAL into veBAL to
      get a host of benefits in the new vote-escrowed (ve) system.

      5. **Onchain Gauge System** - Since transitioning to the veModel, BAL
      emissions get distributed through the gauge system. Gauges allow LPs
      (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT to claim BAL from liquidity
      mining.
