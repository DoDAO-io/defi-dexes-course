    title: Introduction
    details: >-
      A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that operates
      without a central authority. This means that it is not owned or controlled
      by a single entity, and instead relies on a decentralized network of
      computers to facilitate trades.


      Some benefits of decentralized exchanges include:


      1. Censorship resistance: Because decentralized exchanges are not
      controlled by a single entity, they are resistant to censorship. This
      means that users can trade freely without the risk of their transactions
      being blocked or reversed.

      2. Increased security: Decentralized exchanges do not hold users' funds,
      which means that there is a lower risk of funds being stolen or hacked.

      3. Privacy: Decentralized exchanges do not require users to provide
      personal information, which means that trades can be conducted privately.

      4. Accessibility: Decentralized exchanges can be accessed from anywhere in
      the world, as long as the user has an internet connection.

      5. Improved accessibility: Decentralized exchanges are often easier to use
      and more accessible than centralized exchanges, as they do not require
      users to go through a lengthy registration process.

      6. Greater control: Users have greater control over their assets on a
      decentralized exchange, as they are in charge of managing their own
      private keys.

      7. Lower fees: Decentralized exchanges often have lower fees than
      centralized exchanges, as they do not need to cover the costs of
      maintaining a central infrastructure.


      In this chapter we are going to 

      1. Understand why exchanges are need and why people exchange tokens

      2. We then look at new way of exchanging tokens i.e. without the need of
      another party to perform the exchange

      3. Different type of Automated Market Makers
